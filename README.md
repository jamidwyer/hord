# hord

CMS to track personal and community food resources, in hopes of reducing food waste while keeping us all fed! 

I do not plan to make a profit on this labor of love, so if you're a hippie nerd like me, pull requests very gratefully accepted.

Currently very close to ready for some test users!

## Dev

`git submodule init && git submodule update`

`docker compose up --build`

If things go right, you'll see the following:

- a NextJS frontend at http://localhost
- Django admin at http://localhost/admin
- Swagger docs at http://localhost/api/docs
- GraphQL at http://localhost/graphql

Create a superuser:

`docker exec -it hord_server python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Deploy
[Deployment setup](deployment_setup.md)

ssh into server.

Pull changes from this repo.

`docker compose up --build`
